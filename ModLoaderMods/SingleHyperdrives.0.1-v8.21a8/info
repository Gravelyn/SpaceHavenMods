Ever thought the vanilla hyperdrives were too big and bulky and got in the way of designing your perfect ship? Then this is the mod for you!
This mod halves the size of the vanilla hyperdrive to a single engine.
The cost and efficiency has also been halved.
A separate optional class file is available to re-adjust the engine count penalty.
